# Classification-with-Logistic-Regression
This repository contains the complete solution for **Task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression**  
using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Build a **binary classifier** using Logistic Regression, evaluate it using multiple metrics, and visualize key results.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## ðŸ“Š Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading**  
   Loaded the **Breast Cancer dataset** from scikit-learn.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Split data into **Train (80%)** and **Test (20%)** sets.  
   - Standardized features using **StandardScaler**.

3. **Model Training**  
   Trained a **Logistic Regression** model.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - ROC Curve and AUC Score  
   - Threshold tuning for classification.

5. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted ROC Curve  
   - Plotted Sigmoid Function

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- High classification accuracy on test set.
- ROC AUC score close to **1.0**, indicating excellent separation between classes.
- Precision and Recall show balanced performance.


---

## ðŸ“š Learning Points
- Difference between Logistic Regression & Linear Regression.
- Understanding the **Sigmoid Function**.
- Binary classification evaluation metrics.
- Importance of threshold tuning.
